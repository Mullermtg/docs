**If you’re not able to see your Facebook or Instagram page in the selection, it’s most often due to one of the following reasons:**

<Accordion title="We couldn’t connect your pages to an account.">
  If that's the case, you can solve that by following these steps:

  <Steps>
    <Step title='Go to "settings"'>
      <img
        src="/images/FB_IG_PAGE1.png"
        alt="FB IG PAGE1 Pn"
        style={{ width:"55%" }}
      />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select the ad account from the left-hand tab, followed by clicking “Show all Facebook pages” or “Show all Instagram pages,” depending on what’s missing.">
      <img
        src="/images/FB_IG_PAGE3.png"
        alt="FB IG PAGE3 Pn"
        style={{ width:"55%" }}
      />
    </Step>
    <Step title="Here, you should be able to find and connect your Facebook or Instagram page.">
      If that's not the case, make sure to follow the guide **"Still not seeing it? - It may be due to missing permissions"** below.

<Accordion title="Still not seeing it? - It may be due to missing permissions.">
  If you still don’t see your Facebook or Instagram page, it may be because Adtool doesn’t have access to it. You can fix this by reconnecting your Meta account. 

  See how below:

    <Step title="Go to Settings">
      <img
        src="/images/FB_IG_PAGE1.png"
