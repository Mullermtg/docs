      style={{ width:"55%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Now you can make adjustments or launch as is">
    You’ll now notice that all text fields, creatives, settings - everything appear exactly as they did during your previous upload.

    From here, you can make any adjustments you need to text, creatives, campaigns, naming, or other settings before launching again.

    **Note:** Ads in Adtool aren’t locked within a campaign hierarchy like in Meta. You can freely launch the same ads into completely different campaign objectives without losing any of the assets you’ve created.
