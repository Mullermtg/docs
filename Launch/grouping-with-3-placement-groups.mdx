Adtool supports all three placement groups, meaning you can work with one, two or three formats for the same ad.

**Recommended setup:**

- Vertical: 9x16
- Square: 4x5 or 1x1
- Horizontal: 1x1 or 16x9

**BONUS**: Adtool automatically groups your creatives based on their dimensions. No manual placement setup required.

## **How it works**

  <Step title="Select the creatives for your ads and click 'Continue'">
    **TIP**: Find your desired creatives by using filters and/or using 'select all' button.

    You can also click and drag the mouse to easily select your creatives.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Next step is to group the creatives for the ads">
    If two or three creatives share the same name - except for the dimension - Adtool will recognize them as belonging to the same group.

    **We support grouping for all 3 main placement groups.**

    **Dimension formats that we currently support:**\
    1x1, 4x5 & 9x16\
    1:1 & 9:16\
    1_1 & 1_1\
    1-1 & 1-1

    **Example:**\
    'Video V6 9x16', 'Video V6 4x5' & 'Video V6 16x9' will automatically be grouped together.

    This allows you to easily launch ads in multiple aspect ratios without any manual setup.

    If the filenames don’t match, you can still group them manually with a simple drag and drop.
