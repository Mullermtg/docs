      alt="Go To Launch Pn"
      title="Go To Launch Pn"
      style={{ width:"100%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the creatives for your carousel ad and click 'Continue'">
    **TIP:** Find your desired creatives by using filters and/or using 'select all' button.

    You can also click and drag the mouse to easily select your creatives.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Next step is to group creatives for the carousel ads">
    Creatives are automatically grouped based on their filenames.

    <Accordion title="Grouping">
      If two creatives share the same name - except for the dimension at the end - Adtool will recognize them as belonging to the same group.

      **Example:**\
      'Video V6 9x16' and 'Video V6 4x5' will automatically be grouped together.

      This allows you to easily launch ads in multiple aspect ratios without any manual setup.

      If the filenames don’t match, you can still group them manually with a simple drag and drop.
    </Accordion>
    **If your creatives for the carousel are automatically grouped, simply click “Ungroup All.”**

    You can then drag the creatives into the carousel group manually.

    **INFO:** You can create carousels with either a single format or two different formats.

    **NOTE:** If you are using two formats for your carousel - make sure the format 1 and 2 is alligned in the view, to make sure Adtool can match the placements properly

  </Step>
  <Step title="Now you can click “Continue” to start adding your primary text and other details.">
    Make sure to fill out all remaining information such as: primary text, headline, description, CTA, etc.

    **NOTE**: You can customize the text individually for each carousel card. This allows you to tailor headlines, descriptions, and CTAs to match the specific content or creative on each card - giving you full control over the messaging in your carousel ads.
