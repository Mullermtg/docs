### Step-by-step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to 'Launch', and click 'Edit Individually'">
    <img
      src="/images/adjust_single_ads(1).png"
      alt="Adjust Single Ads Pn"
      title="Adjust Single Ads Pn"
      style={{ width:"55%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find the ad(s) you want to adjust individually">
    Now you can edit the fields for that specific ad.

    When you edit one of the fields, that field will become **locked**.

    This means any later batch-level changes (like updating text for all ads at once) **wonâ€™t overwrite** the content in that locked field - allowing you to fully customize specific ads without affecting the rest of the batch.

    <img

      alt="Adjust Individually View Pn"
      title="Adjust Individually View Pn"
      style={{ width:"55%" }}
    />
  </Step>
