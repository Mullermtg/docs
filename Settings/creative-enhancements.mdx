  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your default creative enhancements">
    **You can set the enhancements as you prefer. These will be the default settings for the account.**

    You can always adjust the enhancements for a specific batch under **“Additional Settings”** in **Launch.**

    **Note:** \
    By checking **“Use for all accounts,”** the setting will be applied to all your accounts, so you don’t have to configure them one by one.\
    When you use **“Use for all accounts,”** it will override any customizations already made in other account settings for UTM-parameters.
