    ### What can you change from?

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="File Type">
        **Set custom labels for image and video file types in your naming convention.**

        You can change the naming however you like.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="File Name">
        **If you choose the 'File Name', it will automatically add the name of the creative to the ad.**

        **Example:**\
        _Creative name_: launch_ads_fast-9x16.mp4\
        _Ad name_: 10/28 | VID | Funnel | launch_ads_fast

        **Recommendation:** Adjust the concept description before adding the creative to Adtool for more seamless ad naming.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Date">
        **Choose how dates should be formatted in your ad naming convention.**

        We will automatically add the date of when the ad is created within Adtool.

        You can choose from a various of formats:

        - DD/MM | 28/10
        - MM/DD | 10/28

      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Custom Field">
        Enter the static text that will be added to your ad names. This text will appear exactly as you type it in every ad name.

        'Custom Field' can also be used to act as a placeholder. 

        For example if you need Country in your ad names, we recommend to use 'Custom Field' to set a placeholder for our 'Find & Replace' function within 'Launch'
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Seperators to choose from">
        You can choose from a range of different separators.

    **You can set naming convention as you prefer. These will be the default settings for the account.**

    **Note:** \
    By checking **"Use for all accounts"** the setting will be applied to all your accounts, so you don’t have to configure them one by one.\
    When you use **“Use for all accounts”** it will override any customizations already made in other account settings for UTM-parameters.
